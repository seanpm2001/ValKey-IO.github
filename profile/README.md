## Contributing

Guidelines for contributing can be found in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/blob/unstable/CONTRIBUTING.md) files across the various repositories.

There is one thing that is often missed when contributing. A Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO) is needed on **every commit** in a pull request (PR). This is done by adding `-s` or `--sign-off` when commiting like so `git commit -s`. This will add a `Signed-off-by` line at the bottom and and thereby agrees to the DCO, which you can find below or at [DeveloperCertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/). This is a way of certifiying all incoming contributions are correctly attributed and licensed.
